The Lead UX and UI Designer and I worked together with our CEO to map out the content for the website and then create a design based off the flow of the content. <br /> <br />We looked at different websites we liked, and analyzed the story they told. We chose similar design elements that we liked to include in our website. Once I drew out the wireframes, I began building out the site using Yeoman, Grunt, and Bower (scaffolding package for creating websites)." feature-image="/images/project_stages/points-1.png" %}

We began to realize that certain elements didn't correlate with our messaging, and thus we changed the design while we built. I sat in a conference room with my CEO to finalize the content and edit sections at the same time. <br /><br /> Watch the video to see a demo of this iteration of ViiMed website.

This made it easier for design purposes because I worked with Marketing and our CEO to re-do and re-design the website within 5 days. Each of us worked on a different page - they wrote the content, and I did the artwork as well as designing the layouts. <br /><br /> I learned how to override existing code that existed in the WordPress theme we purchased to make elements look the way I wanted them to. I also added custom CSS to tweak the look of the generic theme template" feature-image="/images/feature/viimed-max.png" %}
