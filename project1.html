      <p style="color: #555555;">I worked with a large team at ViiMed to build a care plan for COPD patients that involved a theme to enhance the patient's journey. We also incorporated aspects of gamification in hopes of driving participation. </p>

      <p class="dark-neutral">The Lead UX and UI Designer and I worked together with the nurse that worked at the COPD Foundation to gain insight on users behavior (both the coach and the patient). We did a lot of secondary research as well and read “Gamification by Design” by Gabe Zichermann and Christopher Cunningham because we came up with the idea to gamify the experience for the patients in order to encourage them to participate in educating themselves on their disease to manage their health and elongate their life. <br /><br />After different wireframes and research, we came up with the theme of a “Journey.” It mimicked the movement of board games with tiles that represented different environments. </p>

    <h3>The Dashboard with Gamification</h3>
    <p>This wireframe shows ideas we discussed a lot of ideas that involved leaderboards and integrating our platform with the COPD Foundation’s social media site, 360social. We also discussed trophy rooms where patients can use their points to “purchase” things that were appealing and helpful to them (bluetooth inhalers, pulse oximeters etc. that connected with our software).  <a class="neutral" href="/assets/dashboards-wireframes3.pdf">View</a> </p>

    <h3>The Journey Through the Environments</h3>
    <p>Upon coming up with the “Journey” theme, the Lead UX and UI Designer drew up a prototype portraying the board game tiles representing each environment. Prior to moving forward with the theme, we met with the marketing team at the COPD Foundation to present it to them. They loved it, and discussed ways to align the branding with the theme (you will see this later on).  <a class="neutral" href="">View</a> </p>

    <h3>Points &amp; Achievements</h3>
    <p>The Lead UX and UI Designer and I realized after talking with development (he was also a front-end developer on the team), that all the major ideas we had were not possible to include on the roadmap for phase 1 of the program’s build. So we chose to include points and achievements for the first phase, so we could build upon it in the future.  <a class="neutral" href="/images/project_stages/gamification-thumbnail.jpg">View</a> </p>

    <h3>The Environments</h3>
    <p>Basics - The country, or "the simple life." Refers to the beginning stages and baseline knowledge for all courses. More Knowledge - The forest, or "further into the woods." Refers to activities with "deeper" knowledge and detailed information. Challenge The Mountain, or "an uphill climb." Refers to the activities that require you to test or challenge yourself. Looking Back - The sky, or "from above." Refers to an overview of your completed activities and what you've gained from them. Bonus - The river, or "side quests." Refers to bonus activities or elective courses you can complete to further your journey.  <a class="neutral" href="/images/project_stages/environment-desc.jpg">View</a> </p>

    <h3>Creating the Elements</h3>
    <p>To bring the theme to reality, we reviewed the bare modules with their chapters to search for common patterns. Based off the common patterns, we designed elements for the repeating patterns  and assigned an environment to each chapter. We used photoshop to draw/create the different objects that emphasized the theme with COPD’s pinwheel logo. We chose color palettes for each environment and feature images to include to convey the specific environment.  <a class="neutral" href="/images/project_stages/elements-grouped.pdf">View</a> </p>

    <h3>Bringing the Theme to Life</h3>
    <p>Here you will see an example of a chapter with all the elements for the forest environment.  The color scheme, the chat bubbles, the download button with the object. If you click view, you can see more examples of the different chapters with their respective environment.  <a class="neutral" href="/images/project_stages/themes.pdf">View</a> </p>

      <h2 class="dark-neutral">Build</h2>
      <p class="dark-neutral">We all worked as one large team and split up the different courses and chapters. The Lead UX and UI designer and I sent out emails with HTML code for the different elements to copy and paste in the form builder (the back end of the software that solution architects used to build out each activity within the care plan). </p>

    <h1>Outcome &amp; User Feedback</h1>
    <p>We created a user survey for patients to fill out while they were completing their program. We asked them all sorts of questions regarding the design, navigation, workflow, and gamification. Most said they really enjoyed the theme and gamification aspect, but that they did not see it as a motivating factor for them. We came to the conclusion that perhaps there was no correlation to motivation  because patients could not do anything with their points (e.g., purchase items in a trophy room). <br /><br />The COPD care plan was up and running. The theme elements and ideas that the Lead UX and UI designer and I developed became a large turning point for how we approached all other care plans. The elements we build were so often reused for other care plans, that we eventually built widgets out of them for solution architects to use instead of copying and pasting HTML code.</p>
