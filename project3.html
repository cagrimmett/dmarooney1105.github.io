      <h1 style="color: #ffffff;">Care Coordinator Dashboard & CHF</h1>
      <p style="color: #ffffff;">I worked directly with a cardiologist to come up with a Congestive Heart Failure program to build with ViiMed’s platform. The idea behind the program was to minimize hospital readmissions during the critical 30 day period after the patient is discharged from the hospital. <br /><br /> We worked together to come up with 3 activities the patient needs to complete in order to stay on track with their health, as well as important elements on the coordinator dashboard that were necessary for nurses to manage patients with the highest risk of readmissions. </p>

      <h2 class="dark-neutral">The Workflow</h2>
      <p class="dark-neutral">The Lead UX and UI Designer and I worked together with the nurse that worked at the COPD Foundation to gain insight on users behavior (both the coach and the patient). We did a lot of secondary research as well and read “Gamification by Design” by Gabe Zichermann and Christopher Cunningham because we came up with the idea to gamify the experience for the patients in order to encourage them to participate in educating themselves on their disease to manage their health and elongate their life. <br /><br />After different wireframes and research, we came up with the theme of a “Journey.” It mimicked the movement of board games with tiles that represented different environments. </p>

      <h2 class="dark-neutral">The Existing Coordinator Dashboard</h2>
      <p class="dark-neutral">The existing ViiMed coordinator dashboard works very well for nurses who need to monitor patients throughout their orthopedic pathway. However, with congestive heart failure, it does not provide the high-risk alerts and prioritization needed to monitor patients who are more likely to be readmitted back to the hospital. It gives no insight at first glance when the patient’s discharge date was or what tasks the nurse or care coordinator need to complete in relation to each patient. </p>

    <h3>The Dashboard with Gamification</h3>
    <p>This wireframe shows ideas we discussed a lot of ideas that involved leaderboards and integrating our platform with the COPD Foundation’s social media site, 360social. We also discussed trophy rooms where patients can use their points to “purchase” things that were appealing and helpful to them (bluetooth inhalers, pulse oximeters etc. that connected with our software).  <a class="neutral" href="/assets/dashboards-wireframes3.pdf">View</a> </p>

    <h3>The Journey Through the Environments</h3>
    <p>Upon coming up with the “Journey” theme, the Lead UX and UI Designer drew up a prototype portraying the board game tiles representing each environment. Prior to moving forward with the theme, we met with the marketing team at the COPD Foundation to present it to them. They loved it, and discussed ways to align the branding with the theme (you will see this later on).  <a class="neutral" href="">View</a> </p>

    <h3>Points &amp; Achievements</h3>
    <p>The Lead UX and UI Designer and I realized after talking with development (he was also a front-end developer on the team), that all the major ideas we had were not possible to include on the roadmap for phase 1 of the program’s build. So we chose to include points and achievements for the first phase, so we could build upon it in the future.  <a class="neutral" href="/images/project_stages/gamification-thumbnail.jpg">View</a> </p>

      <p class="dark-neutral">We all worked as one large team and split up the different courses and chapters. The Lead UX and UI designer and I sent out emails with HTML code for the different elements to copy and paste in the form builder (the back end of the software that solution architects used to build out each activity within the care plan). </p>
