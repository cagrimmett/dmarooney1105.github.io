    <p class="long-primer">ViiMed was asked by COPD Foundation to create an interactive educational program for patients diagnosed with COPD. Our ultimate goal was to engage, educate and change patient behavior.</p>

ViiMed's only healthcare experience thus far was in Orthopaedics but we knew our Chronic Disease template had to be more engaging for a patient population that was never going to be cured.</p>

  <p class="long-primer aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-right">Most of ViiMed's products up until this point, revolved around orthopedics, and therefore the patient did not need to have a "dashboard." They just logged in and went straight to their activity list. <br><br> The Solution Architects used the page builder on the software to create a patient dashboard. The page builder on ViiMed's platform, serves for simple projects such as libraries and such. </p>

  <p class="long-primer text-center aos-init aos-animate" data-aos="fade-right">With the thought of gamification in mind, I decided to begin sketching out wireframes that not only improved the overall look and feel of the dashboard, but also incorporated some gamification elements to it such as: unlocked achievement badges, a trophy room where patients could use their points to purchase a bluetooth inhaler that connected to the platform (or other goodies), etc. </p>

    <p class="long-primer">The COPD Foundation's "Big Fat Reference Guide" book takes on the theme of a safari and exploration on "Lung Island". Any "call outs" or "did you know?" blurbs included a graphical cartoon explorer dressed in safari gear. I worked closely with ViiMeds front-end software engineer took their theme of "Lung Island" and expanded upon it by creating different environmental realms that one would travel through on a game board and applied it to the Care Plan Courses. Each aspect of the program (from individual chapters in a course to library resources) was assigned an "environment."</p>
